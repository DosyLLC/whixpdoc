title: Connection establishement
version: 1

After completing the necessary configuration, it's time to establish an initial connection to the XMPP server.

Connecting to the server with Whixp is straightforward. You only need to call one method to make the connection:

```dart
final whixp = Whixp(
    jabberID: 'vsevolod@localhost',
    password: 'passwd',
    internalDatabasePath: 'initial',
    logger: Log(enableWarning: true),
  );

  whixp.connect();
```

If you check the logs, you will see the "Finished processing stream features." message, which indicates that the connection was successful and that further processing will take place:

```console
[Whixp] SEND: <iq type="set" id="51ec9-2113-8b29-44fbca57"><bind xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:xmpp-bind"/></iq>
[Whixp] RECEIVED: <iq type='result' id='51ec9-2113-8b29-44fbca57' xmlns="jabber:client"><bind xmlns='urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:xmpp-bind'><jid>vsevex@localhost/179773712250924621162146</jid></bind></iq>
[Whixp] SEND: <enable resume="true" xmlns="urn:xmpp:sm:3"/>
[Whixp] RECEIVED: <enabled resume='true' max='30' id='g2gCbQAAABgxNzk3NzM3MTIyNTA5MjQ2MjExNjIxNDZtAAAACKNXIdgVg21Z' xmlns='urn:xmpp:sm:3'/>
[Whixp] Starting Ping keep alive...
[Whixp] Finished processing stream features.
```

## Reconnection policy

You can configure the Whixp instance to automatically reconnect in case of any errors. This can be achieved by providing a reconnection policy; however, the built-in options are limited. You can either develop your own reconnection policy or use the `RandomBackoffReconnectionPolicy` class. You need to specify the minimum and maximum backoff times, from which a random value will be selected for reconnection attempts.

```dart
final whixp = Whixp(
    jabberID: 'vsevolod@localhost',
    password: 'passwd',
    internalDatabasePath: 'whixp',
    reconnectionPolicy: RandomBackoffReconnectionPolicy(0, 1),
  );

    whixp.connect();
```

When there is an error with connection, the Whixp debug output will be similar to this:

```plaintext
[Whixp] Resetting reconnection policy
[Whixp] Trying to connect to localhost on port 5222
[Whixp] Failure occured. Starting random backoff with 5s
[Whixp] Timer elapsed. Waiting for lock...
[Whixp] Reconnecting...
```
